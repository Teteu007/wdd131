            <h2> We Are Blades Tree Removal </h2>
            <p>
                Tree removal is challenging and time consuming work. Whether that's tree trimming, full tree removal, or stump grinding, most people have better things to do on their weekend than swimming through sawdust and woodchips. We respect the self-relient individual who would rather shut their hand in a door than pay someone to cut down a tree for them, but for those projects that seem borderline out of scope, save your back and have us handle it. </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    We have 3 types of jobs, Tree removal, Stump Grinding and Tree Trimming:

                    Tree removal:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Cut it down. Clean it up. Haul it away.
Our job is simple, to make you happy! We love leaving a customer feeling like they got a great deal on tree removal. We can do “drop and chop” jobs at a lower price where we leave the cleanup to you, or we can clean it all ourselves. Some customers like to keep the firewood too; just let us know and we’ll make it happen!

                <p>Stump Grinding:</p>
                <p>Rid your yard of bothersome stumps!
We grind stumps to about six inches below ground level. As long as we can get to it we’ll grind it! (The grinder is about 39″ wide). The mulch and chips created during the grinding process is great to lay in garden and flower beds. We’ll rake everything into one central pile for you to spread where you please.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tree trimming:</p>
                    <p>Tree trimming. Maintain your tree's health.
                        Our arborists are certified through ISA, which means when we trim your trees you don’t have to worry about them dying (yes that can happen if you do it wrong!) or looking ugly and mishaped.</p>
